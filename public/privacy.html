    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> April 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains how we use Google
      Analytics to collect and process information when you visit our website.
    </p>

    <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.,
      to understand how users interact with our website. Google Analytics
      collects data such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The pages you visit on our website</li>
      <li>The time you spend on our site</li>
      <li>Your referring website (the site you came from)</li>
      <li>Your browser type, operating system, and device information</li>
      <li>Other website interactions such as clicks and scrolling behavior</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data helps us improve the functionality and content of our website.
      Google Analytics does not collect personally identifiable information such
      as your name or contact details.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Google Analytics uses cookies, which are small text files stored on your
      device. These cookies allow us to analyze how users interact with our
      site, but the data is anonymized and does not identify you personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can opt out of Google Analytics by using the
      <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"
        >Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a
      >, available here, or by adjusting your browser settings to block cookies.
    </p>

    <h2>IP Anonymization</h2>
    <p>
      We have enabled IP anonymization in Google Analytics, which means that
      Google will not store or process your full IP address. Instead, your IP
      address will be truncated within member states of the European Union or
      other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Manage Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      You can control the use of cookies on our site through your browser
      settings. Please refer to the
      <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank"
        >All About Cookies</a
      >
      website for more details on how to manage and delete cookies.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our privacy policy periodically. Any changes will be
      reflected on this page, and we will update the “last modified” date at the
      top of this page.
