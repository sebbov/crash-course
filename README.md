# Crash Course

https://crash-course.pages.dev/

Crash Course shows a chart of the S&P 500 index during historic downturns, as well as for the current 2025 downturn, normalized to their all-time-high (ATH) leading to the downturn. The y axis shows the drop from the ATH and the x axis the number of days since the ATH.

Original concept and [implementation](https://github.com/resendedaniel/drawdown) by [@resende451](http://x.com/resende451). Crash Course adds interactivity, daily updates, and other features.
